    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      With four years of on-site asset operation experience and six years of
      power system control experience in 10kv to 220kV power supply system, my
      expertise includes HV/MV/LV substation equipment operations and
      maintenance, transmission and distribution system monitoring and
      inspection, Solar and BESS commissioning, power system fault diagnosis,
      grid prevention and and recovery. I am skilled in using industrial
      software such as SCADA and EMS for system monitoring and remote control.
      Additionally, I am adept at adjusting electrical grid operational modes
      and performing dynamic fault analysis based on protection actions.

        <h3>Senior Power System Controller</h3>
        <p>
          State Grid Corporation of China <br />
          Sep 2018 - April 2024 <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As the duty Senior Power System Controller, I collaborated with team
            members to handle various grid faults especially during severe
            weather conditions such as typhoons and heavy rains.
          </li>
          <li>
            Successfully executed 530 operational commands, remotely resolved
            125 power transmission and distribution system faults, and completed
            63 remote commissioning tasks annually over the six years, all with
            a 100% accuracy rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Managed a fault where both the line protection and the main
            transformer's low-side backup protection were triggered, causing the
            main transformer to trip and identified the issue as a cascading
            trip caused by a distribution circuit breaker's failure. Swift
            coordination with substation and line personnel led to the fault
            being isolated and power restored within 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintained bus voltage fluctuations within 3% of the standard
            voltage through proactive voltage and reactive power compensation
            adjustments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conducted dynamic analyses to proactively avoid potential
            large-scale outages by coordinating with thermal power plants to
            reduce output when wind power surges threatened system stability on
            a 220kV transmission line caused by supply-demand imbalance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Won the first prize in the company's electrical technique
            competition and our team won the company's “Power Escort Team” title
            in 2023.
